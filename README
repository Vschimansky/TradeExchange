** Hackathon – Spring Boot REST API **

You are tasked with creating one or more spring-boot REST API(s) to manage a portfolio of financial
instruments (e.g. stocks). At the simplest level, this could consist of a single REST API which will
manage “Trade” resources. In your first version a “Trade” might have the following attributes:
1. Date created
2. Stock Ticker
3. Stock Quantity
4. Requested Price
5. Trade Status (E.g. all trades might initially be marked as “Created”, another component of the system may then “execute” pending trades and update the database record)
